Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-contrib-testem --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-testem');\n```\n\n\n## How to use\n\n### Environments and tasks\n\nWithin your Grunt configuration you have to define one or more environments that Testem will run with:\n\n```javascript\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  testem: {\n    environment1: {\n      // List of files to attach\n      src: [\n        'bower_components/jquery/jquery.js',\n        'source/**/*.coffee',\n        'spec/helpers/*.coffee',\n        'spec/**/*_spec.coffee'\n      ],\n      // Options that will be passed to Testem\n      options: {\n        parallel: 8,\n        launch_in_ci: ['PhantomJS', 'Firefox', 'Safari'],\n        launch_in_dev: ['PhantomJS', 'Firefox', 'Safari']\n      }\n    },\n    environment2: {\n      // ...\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nIn the example given we pass coffee files straight into the `src` and there's no mistake in that. `grunt-contrib-testem` will chew it for you :godmode:.\n\nThere are two modes that you can run tests at:\n  * `grunt testem:ci:<environment>` command-line CI mode\n  * `grunt testem:run:<environment>` Development mode where Testem watches for modifications of files to rerun tests on your behalf\n\n_The default `grunt testem` task runs all settled environments one by one in CI mode._\n\n### Available options\n\nEvery environment can take 3 arguments which are:\n\n  * `src`: the full list of files to run (allows unix glob masks: \"path/**/*.*\"). Files get included into playground in the order they are listed at the array.\n  * `options`: options that get passed to running instance of Testem (they are typically located at Testem config)\n  * `assets`: options that can be used to configure internal instance of Mincer preprocessor\n\n#### Testem options\n\nThe full list of options you can use to affect Testem instance is available [at Testem documentation](https://github.com/airportyh/testem/blob/master/docs/config_file.md#option-reference).\n\nNote also that you can use JS function as hooks:\n\n```javascript\ngrunt.initConfig({\n  testem: {\n    environment1: {\n      src: '*.js'\n      options: {\n        before_tests: function (config, data, callback) {\n          data;         // {}\n          config;       // ... resulting Testem config\n          callback();   // call to finalize hook\n        },\n        on_change: function (config, data, callback) {\n          data;         // {file: '...'}\n          config;       // ... resulting Testem config\n          callback();   // call to finalize hook\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Preprocessor options\n\n  * **assets.port**: port that preprocessing server will listen at (defaults to 7358)\n  * **assets.setup**: callback to use to setup instance of mincer. Gets instance of `Mincer.Environment` as a first parameter and `Mincer` itself as a second.\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nInternally `grunt-contrib-testem` is powered by Mincer and it allows you to organize testing of almost any kind of code no matter how exactly it is organized and what preprocessing it requires. This is exactly how it works:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"http://f.cl.ly/items/0Q2u2v2c1C1e132R3L33/cloud.png\">\n</p>\n\nDuring initialization, plugin setups local Mincer server with project root as an inclusion path. Then it substitutes local paths with URLs served through it. So instead of passing `spec/spec.coffee` to Testem (that will not work obviously), it passes `http://localhost:7358/spec/spec.coffee` and Mincer takes care of the rest. It also intelligently passes proper `watch_files` option to Testem so no worries â€“ autoreload works just fine.\n\nWhat does it mean in other words? It means you can utilize Mincer during the building of your specs or application files. You can use any directives and any Engines it has to offer you (or even write your own). And all that complexity will work blazing fast thanks to built-in Mincer caching! :scream:\n\nSo go ahead, take a look at these samples...\n\n  * [Basic config](https://github.com/inossidabile/grunt-contrib-testem/tree/master/spec/basic)\n  * [Handling Mincer includes](https://github.com/inossidabile/grunt-contrib-testem/tree/master/spec/minced)\n  * [Custom builder in da area](https://github.com/inossidabile/grunt-contrib-testem/tree/master/spec/custom)\n\n... and hurry up to start using it!\n\n## Kudos\n\nHuge thanks goes to [Toby Ho](https://github.com/airportyh/), the original author of Testem that was one by one accepting my pull-requests and modifications that made such integration possible.\n\n## Maintainers\n\n* Boris Staal, [@inossidabile](http://staal.io)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2013 [Boris Staal](http://staal.io)\n\nIt is free software, and may be redistributed under the terms of MIT license.\n\n[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/inossidabile/grunt-contrib-testem/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free \"Bitdeli Badge\")\n",
