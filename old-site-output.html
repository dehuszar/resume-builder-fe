					<h2>Development Expertise <span class="system"> (click items for more details)</span></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							HTML5/CSS3;
							<p class="desc">HTML5 and CSS3 are the latest specifications for defining content and styling for the web.  The additions to the specification provide modern rich media types, and improved semantics which allow the web to become more of an application development platform that works across a variety of mobile and touch devices.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Mobile First Responsive Layouts;
							<p class="desc">Mobile First development and Responsive Web Design are technically two strategies.  The first attempts to create a baseline of reasonable defaults so that if every other aspect of your website fails, or is not supported by the browsing device, will display an attractive low-bandwidth mobile-friendly site.  Responsive Web Design refers to the ability to have a layout adapt to a variety of screen sizes, resolutions, and types.  The end result is a single website which elegantly adapts to potentially any browsing device or orientation.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							JQuery, JQueryUI;
							<p class="desc">JQuery and JQueryUI are javascript libraries which make writing javascript routines and interactive interface elements a breeze.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							ExpressionEngine CMS;
							<p class="desc">ExpressionEngine is a powerful framework for creating custom datatypes and displaying dynamic views of that data.  While it is a commercial product, it is built on the open-source PHP framework called Codeigniter.  If WordPress can be considered a publishing tool, ExpressionEngine would be a workshop for building printing presses.  I have built several web sites and applications with ExpressionEngine, and have yet to find a project more complicated than a simple blog or marketing site which could not be built better using it over alternative platforms.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							WordPress CMS;
							<p class="desc">WordPress is a very popular open-source publishing program.  While technically a Content Management System, WordPress is at it's best for developing blogs and simple feeds of data.  I have created several websites using WordPress, and while I prefer to develop using ExpressionEngine, WordPress is still handy for small-scope or low-budget projects.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Git;
							<p class="desc">Git is a version management tool that makes it easy to manage changes to a project, and send those changes from development to staging and production servers.  It is also designed to encourage distributed team development allowing any developer to check out a project, make changes to their copy and allow Changes to this website are managed with Git.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Vim;
							<p class="desc">Some folks like to use Dreamweaver to code their websites.  I've found that any tool that writes code for you, while saving time during the design process, adds to the debugging process and can create a tremendous drag on load times.  Vim makes hand-coding a breeze, and is installed on every UNIX-based system making it easy to code remotely on the server hosting the website.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="large">
					<h2>Sys-Admin Expertise<span class="system"> (click items for more details)</span></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Ubuntu Linux Desktops;
							<p class="desc">Ubuntu is a cutting edge, intuitive, touch-enabled open-source Linux distribution.  I have implemented Ubuntu desktops in several businesses who upon consultation realized they didn't really need to be spending their money on Windows software licenses, security, and maintenance costs.  Not every business can get away from specific Windows or Mac-based applications, but if one doesn't have such a constraint, the latest versions of Ubuntu provide one of the most elegent operating systems available.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Ubuntu Linux Servers;
							<p class="desc">Much like the amazing Ubuntu Desktops, Ubuntu server is perfect for providing services to local networks, or the entire web.  In fact, this website is hosted on an Ubuntu web server sitting in my living room.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							SSH / Rsync;
							<p class="desc">SSH is a mechanism for creating an encrypted connection between systems.  It allows you to remotely control, or otherwise communicate with other systems.  I use SSH to log into my development and staging servers to develop.  Rsync is a mechanism for keeping selected files and folders in sync.  Together with SSH, Rsync is an excellent mechanism for running incremental backups, or keeping resources available in multiple environments.</p>

				<h2>Center for Civic Reflection</h2>
				<p>(Still in development)  The Center for Civic Reflection (CCR) needed to replace an ageing custom built CMS that had been in use for almost 10 years.  It needed to allow flexible data entry and search, and allow easy relationships to be defined between entries and entry-types.  The application itself is, at it's core, a resource for civic-engagement facilitators to look up readings, discussion plans, facilitation summaries, and related media for use in targetted discussions and workshops.  We built the site with ExpressionEngine due to it's ability to create custom data channels and views with ease.</p>
				<p>Notable features include</p>
				<ul>
					<li>rather than have CCR log into the control panel to manage the site (which can require extra training, and less control over functionality without tremendous development overhead), we streamlined the data-entry/management process by creating all the entry creation and management so it could be handled via the primary 'front-end' interface if logged in with a user account of sufficient privileges;</li>
					<li>the ability to load forms-within-forms for entries which needed to be related to other entries which had not yet been added to the CMS;</li>
					<li>wide range of related content displaying dynamically, depending on one's location in the site;</li>

				<h2>Worklocal</h2>
				<p>Worklocal is a job matching site which seeks to match potential applicants in the communities surrounding the new Green Exchange Business Park in Logan Square with tenants as they move into the building.  The website needed to be able to provide application and resume forms for applicants, display current jobs in the system, and allow applicants to express interest in available positions.</p>
				<p>The website also needed to be accessible by applicants both young and old, so the site had to function in older browsers that might be available in a library, or a computer which has not been frequently updated, as well as the latest smart-phones and mobile devices</p>
				<p>Notable features include</p>
				<ul>
					<li>responsive interface and layout which adapts from limited viewing environments such as phones and 7in tablets to traditional laptop and desktop screen sizes;</li>
					<li>extensive reporting capabilities for registrants, applications, and resumes currently in the system;</li>
					<li>applicant status tracking so worklocal team members can assist applicants in a targetted way to increase placement opportunities;</li>

				<h2>Schwa Restaurant</h2>
				<p>Schwa Restaurant is a fine dining experience created by 'serial James Beard award nominee' Michael Carlson.</p>
				<p>Every aspect of the restaurant a work of art.  Be it the refined flavors Carlson develops from his pioneering use of molecular gastronomy, or the stunning visual work for each course's plating, the senses are overwhelmed when eating at Schwa.  We tried to capture the beauty of each bite, and constant motion in the dining space as the staff assembles each patrons meal and hurries it to the table.</p>
				<p>To do this, we created stencils of the schwa logo, and had the staff plate several versions of the stencils as though they were meals.  These platings were used throughout the website as section-specific logos, background illustrations and also as anchors for developing the site's palette.</p>
				<p>Notable features include</p>
				<ul>
					<li>section-specific video mastheads</li>
					<li>hand-coded from scratch using PHP and JQuery</li>

Aside from my time consulting at LSNA, John and I worked together via the Cooper Lamp Task Force, a neighborhood coalition designed to help provide better severance and job placement for the employees at the Cooper Lamp factory.  The Task Force was instrumental in steering the Cooper Lamp factory into eventually becoming the Green Exchange building instead of condos.
